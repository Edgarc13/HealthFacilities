## Map of Veteran's Affairs Health Offices

**Background**
Having family members who have served in the armed forces I created this map as a way to provide infromation for those out of deployment/in the reserves.

** Instructions **
This map is a chloropleth map meaning that each color shade corresponds to a group of numbers. The lighter and greener the color corresponds to a lower amount of healthcare facilities in the state, vice versa for darker blue colors. 
Clicking on a state displays the locations of each facility within that state. Hovering over the point displays a box containing information about the facilitiy that includes:
- Address
- Address2 (if applicable)
- City
- County
- Zip
- Directions (if applicable)
- Phone
- NAISC Description (if applicable

##### Known Issues
The most prevalent issue regarding the map had to do with displaying the points. Clicking on a state displays points both in and certain points in surrounding states. As it does not affect map usage, however, it does not need to be rectified.
